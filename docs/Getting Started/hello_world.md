Every programming language needs to be able to print a line.

In `Example.mvn`, write the following:
```
println("Hello World from Maven!") // This is a comment, that means anything after the '//' will be ignored until the next line, it's useful for annotating code for example:
// The above line prints a hello world statement ^
```

To compile this run:
```
maven build
```

Output:
```
Hello World from Maven!
```
